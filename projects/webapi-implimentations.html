                <p>
                    Web API Implimentations is actually called Web Crypto Implimentations, but stop! don't run away
                    because it says crypto! This project is not a cryptocurrency project, it's a project that that
                    impliments the Web Crypto API, which is <em>cryptography</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Now that we've cleared that up, let's talk about the project. I created this because I wanted an
                    easy way to use the Web Crypto API in cloudflare workers. NodeJS has a built in crypto module, but
                    cloudflare workers would have needed nodejs compat enabled which isn't recommended.
                    <br><br>
                    There's not much else to say! Something odd about the project is that it works mostly on keys that
                    have been converted to strings. I did this because of more compatibility with storing the key if
                    ever needed be, but it shouldn't affect performance much if at all.
