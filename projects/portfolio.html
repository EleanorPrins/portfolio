                    This portfolio design was inspired by another portfolio I found online. I loved the simplicity and
                    modern look of it, but I never got around to doing anything with it. It's been a couple years since
                    then, and I unfortunately can't find the original portfolio to credit the creator. If you know who
                    it is, please let me know so I can give them the credit they deserve!
                    <br><br>
                    Obviously, I've found the courage to create the portfolio now, and I'm really happy with how it's
                    turned out. I've created it entirely from scratch using only html, css, and js. I've also made it
                    responsive, so it should look good on any device (Hopefully!).
                    <br><br>
                    The project is open source with an MIT license, so feel free to use it for your own portfolio! You
                    don't need to credit me or anything, but I'd love to see what you do with it if you do use it, so
                    if you'd like shoot me an email if you do!
