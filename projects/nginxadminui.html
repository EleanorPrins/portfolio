                    This is a project I've been working on for a while now. It's gone through many, many phases but I'm
                    pretty happy with where it's ended up. After using projects like <a
                        href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/" target="_blank">Nginx Proxy Manager</a> I began to feel
                    frustrated with
                    the lack of static site support and php support. Of course, anyone who can read should note that it
                    says <em>Proxy</em> manager.
                    <br><br>
                    So I came up with my own solution! Nginx Admin UI is a web interface for managing Nginx. It's
                    designed to be simple and easy to use, and it's what's running this site right now! It's got support
                    for php built in, editing the config files, and even a file manager for your site. It's still in
                    alpha, but I'm working on it as much as I can.
                    <br><br>
                    If you think this project interests you, please give it a try! I'd love to hear your feedback on it,
                    and with being a simple docker-compose.yml file to run it, it should be easy to get up and running.
